# PostgreSQL Logical Replication CDC Module for Go [![Go](https://github.com/usedatabrew/pglogicalstream/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/usedatabrew/pglogicalstream/actions/workflows/go.yml)

This Go module builds upon [github.com/jackc/pglogrepl](https://github.com/jackc/pglogrepl) to provide an advanced
logical replication solution for PostgreSQL. It extends the capabilities of jackc/pglogrep for logical replication by
introducing several key features, making it easier to implement Change Data Capture (CDC) in your Go-based applications.

## Features

- **Checkpoints Storing:** Efficiently manage and store replication checkpoints, facilitating better tracking and
  management of data changes.

- **Snapshot Streaming:** Seamlessly capture and replicate snapshots of your PostgreSQL database, ensuring all data is
  streamed through the pipeline.

- **Table Filtering:** Tailor your CDC process by selectively filtering and replicating specific tables, optimizing
  resource usage.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with our PostgreSQL Logical Replication CDC Module for Go:

### Install the module

```go
import (
    "github.com/usedatabrew/pglogicalstream"
)

```

### Configure your replication stream

Create `config.yaml` file

```yaml
db_host: database host
db_password: password12345
db_user: postgres
db_port: 5432
db_name: mocks
db_schema: public
db_tables:
  - rides
replication_slot_name: morning_elephant
tls_verify: require
stream_old_data: true
```

### Basic usage example

By default`pglogicalstream`will create replication slot and publication for the tables you provide in Yaml config
It immediately starts streaming updates and you can receive them in the `OnMessage` function

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "github.com/usedatabrew/pglogicalstream"
  "gopkg.in/yaml.v3"
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"
)

func main() {
  var config pglogicalstream.Config
  yamlFile, err := ioutil.ReadFile("./example/simple/config.yaml")
  if err != nil {
    log.Printf("yamlFile.Get err   #%v ", err)
  }

  err = yaml.Unmarshal(yamlFile, &config)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Unmarshal: %v", err)
  }

  pgStream, err := pglogicalstream.NewPgStream(config, log.WithPrefix("pg-cdc"))
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }

  pgStream.OnMessage(func(message messages.Wal2JsonChanges) {
    fmt.Println(message.Changes)
  })
}

```

### Example with checkpointer

In order to recover after the failure, etc you have to store LSN somewhere to continue streaming the data
You can implement `CheckPointer` interface and pass it's instance to  `NewPgStreamCheckPointer` and your LSN
will be stored automatically

```go
checkPointer, err := NewPgStreamCheckPointer("redis.com:port", "user", "password")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Checkpointer error")
}
pgStream, err := pglogicalstream.NewPgStream(config, checkPointer)
```
